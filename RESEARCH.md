1/31/19 - Data Mining Research

It would be preferable if I can get data directly from a 3ds cartridge, as opposed to crawling some poor site to get it.

I got a `.cia` file (much like a `.3ds` file) of a game I own. I was able to decode it down into `.bin` files using some software, but I wasn't able to get additional tools working to decrypt it further.

`aspir` may be my only choice.
