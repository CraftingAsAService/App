### Logo Thoughts

Logo Credit, altered

https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=ninja&i=2336759
Ninja by Anthony Ledoux from the Noun Project
Use the embedded attribution only if the icon is larger than 100px.
Copy the attribution text below and include it in a bibliography or image caption.

Looking for Logo Artist.
Will mostly sit against #403351 and #2b2236
Primary color #ff4040
Secondary Yellow/Accents if needed #daeb4e #f0dc50
Other purples, if needed #6441a4 #8c379e
Attempting to mimic logo with theme I paid for ("Primary Color Border" thing I like most)
Doesn't have to use the words "Crafting Ninja". No words is okay. "CN" lapel would be neat. Open to interpretation here.

### Other Notes

- Mid-mysql8 transition on computer, Sketched instead
